** MapCountyPOWPUMA
*** Description
Counties are nested in Place of Work PUMAs for the 2010 Census convention, which is in effect for survey years beginning in 2012. Surveys from 2011 and before use the 2000 Census definition of Place of Work PUMAs, which are not always wholly nested in counties. This data relates counties to the 2000 Census definition of POWPUMAs under the POWPUMAType 'POWPUMA2K', and the 2010 Census definition under the POWPUMAType 'POWPUMA12'. Additionally, this data provides a weight variable based on the 2010 Census population that can be used for aggregation when counties are note wholly nested in POWPUMAs.

*** Description
A simple relation between the school year and the index year for joining index results to district level data.
